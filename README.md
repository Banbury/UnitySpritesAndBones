Unity Sprites And Bones
=======================

This is an addon for Unity 3D to create 2D skeletal sprite animations. With the addon it's possible to create bone hierarchies directly in the Unity Editor. Sprites can be parented to the bones. The bones can be animated like any other GameObject in the animator window. Inverse Kinematics is also available and animatable. The bones can also be used to animate any other GameObject like meshes or particle systems.

## Installation
After importing the Unity package into a new project, the Gizmo folder has to be moved to the Asset folder. Otherwise some icons won't show up in the editor and the hierarchy.
